{{!--HOW TO USE
Add this to your template to display the searchbar and advanced search panel.
Syntax:
{{search-searchbar fields=recordFields param=text onChange=(action "updateParams")}}
fields: an array of objects containing the model's DS.Attrs as 'value' and a human-readable version as 'title'
an object containing pagination metadata for current model (results_count, page, and per_page)
param: variable for the queryparam that represents searches -- allows current value to be populated into search bar on page load
onChange: action to be executed when queryParams are changed by this component.

<form method="post" class="form-inline" {{action "executeSearch" searchParams on="submit"}}>
  <div class="input-group" role="group" aria-label="Search">
    <label for="searchbar-search" class="sr-only">Enter search text</label>
    {{input
      id="searchbar-search"
      class="form-control"
      value=searchParams.text
    }}
    <span class="input-group-btn">
      <label for="search-button" class="sr-only">Execute search</label>
      <button id="search-button" class="btn btn-primary" type="submit">
        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search"></span>
      </button>
    </span>

    {{!--Note: Search Syntax
      Coast Salish -> searches anything containing both "Coast" and "Salish"
      "Coast Salish" -> searches anything for the specific phrase, "Coast Salish"
      Salish OR Wellington -> anything with "Salish" or anything with "Wellington"
      Salish~ -> includes anything with a word similar to "Salish"
      Salish NOT Wellington -> includes anything with "Salish", but not if it also contains "Wellington"
      Sal* -> includes any results containing a word starting with "Sal"
      Wom*n -> includes "Woman" or "Women"

      Do we build advanced search features to visually allow for these different methods, or should we just provide a
      box that explains the syntax to users?

  {{#if showAdvancedSearch}}
    {{!--Note: State of advanced search
    On an advanced search with only one facet value, wildcards may be used, so searches could be slightly vague.
    (eg, a search for AND=subject:Coast* will return results for any subject that starts with "Coast".)
    Note: these searches are case sensitive, and the facet must start with the given string.
    Because of this, the ability to successfully return search results for advanced searches seems fairly limited.

    It may be best to rely on facet filters for most advanced search, with some exceptions:
    - If we wanted, we could use a slider for indicating item date.
    - If any facets are deemed significant for formulating a search, like institution, CC-type, etc, we can move these
    facets out of the lists they're currently in, and into select boxes.  However, they would function fundamentally
    the same as the current facets component.
